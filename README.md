Welcome to the Marketing Campaign Optimization repository! 🌟

## Overview
This repository houses our magical machine learning regression model designed to optimize marketing campaigns. Whether you’re a data sorcerer or a marketing enthusiast, this README will guide you through the enchanting world of campaign optimization. For more Detailed Code please go to (marketing_strategy.ipynb) 

## Motivation
Marketing campaigns are like ancient spells—we cast them into the world, hoping they’ll resonate with our audience. But how do we ensure our incantations yield the most potent results? That’s where our model steps in.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/marketing-campaign-ml.git

## Dependencies:
Our Analysis requires Python 3.7+ and the following magical libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. 

## Insights and Spells
Data Preparation:
Our crystal ball (dataset) contains historical campaign data—impressions, clicks, conversions, and more.
Cleanse the data, handle missing values, and transform it into a format our model can understand.

## Regression Model:
i’ve chosen the mystical Linear Regression spellbook to predict campaign performance.
Tune the model’s parameters and evaluate its accuracy.

## Optimization Recommendations:
Our model reveals which campaign settings yield the highest conversions for Each Hospital Type 
Adjust budgets, bidding strategies, and creative elements accordingly.

* Case Explanation - Medium Facility
